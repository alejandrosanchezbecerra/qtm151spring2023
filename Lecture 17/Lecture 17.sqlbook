SQL is a language specializing in database management

- Widely used in industry
- Typical task is to extract data from server
- Many concepts are similar to Python

Getting started:
- Follow installation instructions on Github
- Create a new connection in the "Database" <br>
panel on the left:

- Make sure to click on the "localhost" tab 
- If you don't, you won't be able to run the code

-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size = "5">

Delete existing table
-- SQLBook: Code
-- If the table already exists we can drop it:
-- If it doesn't exist nothing happens
-- System commands are in upper case and user defined
-- names are in lower case
-- Comments are written with double dashes "--" rather than hastag (#)

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS drivers;
-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size = "5">

Create empty table from codebook
-- SQLBook: Code
-- Create empty TABLE called "drivers"
-- This example has five arguments separated by a comma
-- that contain the "column_name" and "column_type", respectively

CREATE TABLE drivers(
    driver_id int,
    driver_name varchar(30),
    nationality varchar(15),
    victories int
);    
-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size="5"> 

Add rows to table
-- SQLBook: Code
-- "INSET INTO" adds rows with VALUES ... to the bottom of the table
-- In SQL different lines need to be separated by a semicolon ";"
-- You write system commands in capital letters to easily distinguish
-- column names from system commands

INSERT INTO drivers  VALUES (1, 'Lewis Hamilton','British',103);

INSERT INTO drivers  VALUES (4, 'Fernando Alonso', 'Spanish',32);

INSERT INTO drivers  VALUES (3, 'Sebastian Vettel', 'German',91);

INSERT INTO drivers  VALUES (2, 'Michael Schumacher', 'German',53);

-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size="5"> 

View the table in the VSC "Database" Panel

$\qquad$ <img src="figures/view_table_sql.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/>

-- SQLBook: Code
-- In SQL, a set of tables is called a "Schema"
-- Click "refresh" to see changes
-- The pencil button edits column attributes
-- The three-stripes button opens the table
-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size="5"> 

Try it yourself!

- Add two/three more rows on your own
-- SQLBook: Code
-- Add your name/nationality and your neighbors'
-- Select a new driver id (needs to be unique)
-- Make sure to deparate arguments by a semicolon!


INSERT INTO drivers  VALUES (5, 'Michael ', 'Bristish',73);
INSERT INTO drivers  VALUES (6, 'bill', 'German',135);

Extracting columns from table
-- SQLBook: Code
-- SELECT extracts certain COLUMNS
-- FROM is used to indicate the source table

SELECT driver_id, nationality FROM drivers;
-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size="5"> 

Extract all columns from table
-- SQLBook: Code
-- The symbol "*" is a shorthand for "all variables"
SELECT * FROM drivers;
-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size = "5">

Subsetting rows
-- SQLBook: Code
-- The WHERE command evaluates logical conditions to subset rows
SELECT * FROM drivers
WHERE nationality = 'German';

-- Evalute OR conditions
SELECT * FROM drivers
WHERE (nationality = 'United States') OR (nationality = 'Indian');

-- Evaluate AND conditions
SELECT * FROM drivers
WHERE (nationality = 'German') AND (driver_id = 2);

-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size="5"> 

Aggregate
-- SQLBook: Code
-- To compute aggregate statistics use a statistic function,
-- such as SUM() or AVG() 
-- The AS is an alias which assigns a name to the aggregate statistic

SELECT SUM(victories) AS sum_victories,
       COUNT(*) AS num_rows,
       AVG(victories) AS mean_victories,
       MIN(victories) AS min_victories,
       MAX(victories) AS max_victories
FROM drivers;
-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size="5"> 

Sort
-- SQLBook: Code
-- Order in ascending order of victories
-- Remember that * means that all columns are selected
SELECT * FROM drivers
ORDER BY victories ASC;

-- Order in descending order of victories
SELECT * FROM drivers
ORDER BY victories DESC;
-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size = "5">

<span style="color:red"> Common pitfall: </span> Remember to use single quotes!



-- SQLBook: Code
-- The following code would NOT work because we used double quotations
-- "Double quotations" are used to refer to column names
SELECT * FROM drivers
WHERE nationality = 'German';
-- SQLBook: Markup
<font size = "5">

Try it yourself!

- Select "nationality" and "driver_id" for drivers <br>
with more than 60 victories
-- SQLBook: Code
-- Write your own code!
SELECT nationality,driver_id FROM drivers
WHERE victories > 60;

Groupby + Aggregate
-- SQLBook: Code
-- This command computes summary statistics by nationalitySELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rows,
-- Including "nationality" (the grouping column) is optional in the select
SELECT nationality,
       SUM(victories) AS sum_victories,
       AVG(victories) AS mean_victories,

Subsetting **after** aggregating
-- SQLBook: Code
-- This command computes the same table as above
-- then filters with HAVING
-- HAVING is the command you use to subset *after* aggregating
-- This differs from WHERE which is use to subset *before* aggregating

SELECT nationality,
       SUM(victories) AS sum_victories,
       AVG(victories) AS mean_victories,
       MIN(victories) AS min_victories,
       MAX(victories) AS max_victories
FROM drivers
GROUP BY nationality
HAVING SUM(victories) > 50;

Subsetting **before** and **after** aggregating
-- SQLBook: Code
-- HAVING is the command you use to subset *after* aggregating
-- This differs from WHERE, which is used to subset *before* aggregating
-- SQL differentiates the two types of subsetting

SELECT nationality,
       SUM(victories) AS sum_victories,
       AVG(victories) AS mean_victories,
       MIN(victories) AS min_victories,
